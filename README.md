# PID-Control-of-an-Unmanned-Ground-Vehicle
• Programmed PID and LQR controller algorithms in MATLAB for a line following, obstacle avoiding, and platooning robot using Lego     Mindstorm EV3 as a test bed. 
• Built circuits for interfacing ultrasonic sensors and light sensors to the EV3 and performed gain-scheduling for the PID controller.
